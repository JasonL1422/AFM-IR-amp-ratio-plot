# AFM-IR-amp-ratio-plot

* This Mathematica script is to map the ratio of IR amplitudes at different wavenumbers in AFM-IR analysis, which is not available in some manufacturer software.
* You should have input files in .csv format with four rows about the measurement information by extracting data from the software. Open and check the sample .csv files.
* Sample data and images are not allowed to be used public without permission.
* Additional data processing such as normalization, etc to increase the contrast.
